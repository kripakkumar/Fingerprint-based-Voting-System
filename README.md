# Fingerprint-based-Voting-System
 A Secure Real-Time Voting solution Integrating Biometric Authentication and Embedded IoT Systems .This project implements a secure fingerprint-based voting system using an ESP32 and R307 fingerprint sensor.  


# Fingerprint-based Voting System

This is a secure and efficient voting system using fingerprint authentication and RTOS.

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used
- ESP32
- RTOS (Real-Time Operating System)
- Firebase (IoT integration)
- UART Communication
- C Programming (Embedded C)

## ðŸ“¦ Features
- Voter authentication using fingerprint module
- Data sent to Firebase for real-time monitoring
- RTOS-based task management for better timing and control

## ðŸš€ How to Use
1. Upload code to the ESP32 board.
2. Connect fingerprint sensor via UART.
3. Configure Firebase credentials.
4. Monitor results in Firebase database.
